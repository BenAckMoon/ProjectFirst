        <h1> Little About Me ! </h1>
        <section class="About-Me">
            <h2> My interresse for coding</h2>
                <p>First of all, what does “coding” mean?
            Coding is computer programming, which allows the writing of programs to develop software, or a web page, for example, but also to tell a machine what to do, to guide it. 
                <br><strong> Why does this interest me? </strong>Because I would like this info page to open when I click there, for the text to appear on a blue background. The most interesting thing in the end is therefore the finalities, which can be very diverse but the code is the initial language necessary for these uses and that is where it all starts.
            For someone like me, new to level computing, the code was a mystery until a few weeks ago.
                <br><strong>One certainty: this will be essential for my future projects.</strong></p>
        
            <h2> My educational and career experiences</h2>
                <p>I obtained a <strong>Scientific Baccalaureate in 2015.</strong>
                <br> I graduated with a <strong>B.A in Criminlogy and Middle East studies </strong>from Ariel University in 2021.
                <br>To this day, I don't really have a professional career. I have worked before but only to earn a living.</p>
            <h2> My personal interests</h2>
                <p>Since I learned to code, it has become a passion. Of course, I still have a lot to learn, but slowly I'm making progress, even alone. When I find my teammate, I like to play tennis once a week.
            I like to study Chassidus because it helps a lot in understanding the process of the world and its direction.
            Obviously I keep my free time to be able to enjoy with my wife and my two young children.</p>
